# Captcha-Generator
Random Captcha Generator implemented in JS. Captchas are widely used as a security measure to ensure that the user interacting with a website is indeed a human, rather than a malicious script or bot. This generator creates a random sequence of six words in text format, making it easy to integrate into any web form requiring captcha verification.
